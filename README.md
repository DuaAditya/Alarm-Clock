# Alarm-Clock

Recently, I discovered that our brain is usually active for 25â€“30 minutes at a stretch.
After that, we should take a break for at least 5 minutes.

To make my study sessions more effective, I decided to make a Python application for myself that helps me study for 25 minutes and then sounds the alarm.
The alarm clock also has the functionality to actively update the time according to the user's system.
After that, the user can set a 10 or 15 minutes timer for a break.
The user can also input a time according to their preferences.

There is a stop button to stop the ringing alarm when the time is up.

For this project, I used tkinter, playsound and pygame. 
The Tkinter module is being used for the application itself. Whereas, pygame and playsound are being used for sounding the alarm.
