# Alarm-Clock

# Recently I discovered that our brain is usually active for 25-30 minutes in a stretch.
# After that we should take a break for at least 5 minutes.

# To make my study sessions more effective I decided to make a python application for myself that helps me study for 25 minutes and then sounds the alarm.
# The alarm clock also has the functionality to actively update time according to user's system.
# After that the user can set a 10 or 15 minutes timer for break.
# The user can also input a time according to themselves.

# There is a stop button to stop the ringing alarm when the time is up.
